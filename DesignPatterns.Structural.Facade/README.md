# Facade

Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## When to use

* When it's desired to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
* When it's desired to structure a subsystem into layers.

## Pros

* Isolation of code from the complexity of a subsystem.

## Cons

* Can become a "god" object coupled to all classes within an application.
