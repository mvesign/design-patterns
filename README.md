# Design Patterns

A set of projects for possible design patterns within C#.

## Creational

Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. when creating an object of a class).

Examples of creational design patterns are:

* Abstract pattern
* Builder
* Factory Method
* Prototype
* Singleton

## Structural

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Examples of structural design patterns are:

* Adapter
* Bridge
