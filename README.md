# Design Patterns

A set of projects for possible design patterns written in C#.

## Patterns

### Creational

Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. when creating an object of a class).

Examples of creational design patterns are:

* Abstract pattern
* Builder
* Factory Method
* Prototype
* Singleton

### Structural

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Examples of structural design patterns are:

* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy

## How to run

To start one project and see how it performs, execute the following command.

```
dotnet run --project .\<NAME-OF-PROJECT>\
```

Where `<NAME-OF-PROJECT>` needs to be replaced by the directory of the actual design pattern you want to start. E.g `DesignPatterns.Creational.AbstractFactory`.
